# body
A combination of head/tail and grep. You grep for a pattern, then it gives you the surrounding text.

# Description
"body" is a combination of the well known commands head/tail and grep. The problem with grep is that if you want to search for a pattern in a file and then read the surrounding text, you normally have to cat out the whole text, or open it in an editor. With body, you can just grep for the pattern and read all of the text surrounding that line.
